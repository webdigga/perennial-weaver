Our Turn Twill Cotton Scarf and matching Pouch celebrate the beauty of traditional weaving techniques reimagined for modern life. Each piece is meticulously handcrafted on our studio looms using premium cotton yarn in a distinctive turn twill pattern that creates subtle texture and visual interest.

Drape yourself in comfort with this versatile cotton scarf. The turn twill weaving technique creates a reversible fabric with a beautiful drape that transitions effortlessly from casual to elegant occasions. The natural cotton fibers provide breathable warmth in cooler weather while remaining lightweight enough for year-round wear. Hand-woven from 100% premium cotton with generous dimensions for versatile styling options, each scarf is finished with delicate fringe. Every piece is unique with subtle variations that reflect its handmade nature.

The matching cotton pouch serves as both a protective storage space for your scarf and a versatile accessory in its own right. Perfect for organizing essentials while traveling or for adding a touch of handwoven elegance to everyday outings. Crafted from the same premium cotton and turn twill pattern, it's the perfect size for essentials like phone, keys, and small treasures.

This matching set arrives beautifully presented, making it an ideal gift for those who appreciate handcrafted quality and sustainable design. A thoughtful choice for birthdays, holidays, or as a special treat for yourself.
