Hello! I’m so glad you’ve chosen something from Perennial Weaver – each piece is made by hand with a lot of care, and I really hope you love it. But if something’s not quite right, I’ll always do my best to help.

## Changing Your Mind

If you’d like to return something, just get in touch within **14 days** of receiving it. The item needs to be unused and in its original condition, with any packaging or tags still intact.

To arrange a return, please email me at [{{ settings.email }}](mailto:{{ settings.email }}) with the **Catalogue Number** of the item and a quick note about why you’d like to return it.

## What I Can’t Take Back

As everything is handmade, there are a few things I’m not able to accept as returns:

- Items that have been used, washed, or damaged after they arrived  
- Custom or made-to-order pieces  
- Returns requested after the 14-day period

I also can’t offer returns for general wear and tear – but if something arrives damaged or isn’t quite right, please do reach out so I can sort it.

## Refunds

Once I’ve received the item back and checked it over, I’ll let you know. If everything’s in order, I’ll process your refund to your original payment method within **5–7 working days**.

Please note that return postage is your responsibility unless the item was faulty or sent in error.

Thank you so much for supporting my work – it really means a lot.

Warm wishes,  
Anne-Marie Wylie
